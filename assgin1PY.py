k=5
j=9
k=k+k++-++j+k#1)prefix increment the value then performs calcuation
#2)postfix calculates then increment the value
#3)if prefix is completed in one gn exp then the value of variable changes there son the changed value will be continued in expression untill it is changd by the nxt statement over same epression
print("k=",+k)#here after k+ exp since k is postfix incremented after completing exp so k=6
print("j=",+j)
